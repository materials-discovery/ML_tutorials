Machine learning tutorials for NSCI0028

In this tutorial, we introduce first the basics to start using Python for data mining and machine learning.

The student should follow the following steps:

1- Start by copying the link to the Jupyter Notebook from the folder in GitHub entitled "Basics_in_Python.ipynb"

2- Open Colab in the link below:
https://colab.research.google.com/

3- Select the tab Github and paste the link in the dedicated field to search for the Notebook

4- Open the link of the Notebook and press Connect

5- Each time, you would like to run an exercise, press on the small triangle in the black circle and wait for a few second to see the output underneath the code.

6- When you finish all the exercice, open a fresh colab session and choose another notebook.

7- Follow this order of the notebooks:

      a- Basics_in_Python.ipynb

      b-Introduction_to_NumPy.ipynb

      c-Introduction_to_Pandas.ipynb
